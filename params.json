It really becomes pain for developers to organize the code in there desired manner. As developer you would want to follow your own design pattern.\r\n\r\nBut while following your own design pattern we would end up writing whole chunk of code in multiple js files each time while adding a js file you need to go ahead and include the js file into your html. At certain point it becomes the tedious task for developers.\r\n\r\nYo.js tries to solve your problem by tracking and synchronously including all js and css files. It provides flexibility for developers to have their own namespace mapped to there respective js files.\r\n\r\nYo.js is currently in beta version.\r\n\r\nTested and supported browsers IE 9+, Mozilla, Chrome.    \r\n\r\n### Usage & API's\r\n\r\n1.
